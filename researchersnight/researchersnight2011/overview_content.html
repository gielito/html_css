                  <br>
<span class="text-rn"><span class="text-rn"><span class="text-rn">The Researchers' Night is an event bringing together the public at large and researchers. It occurs annually on the fourth Friday of September all over Europe. Its main objective is to reveal scientists and science in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere. </span></span></span></h1>
<h1 class="text-rn"><span class="text-rn"><span class="text-rn"><span class="text-rn">The Researchers' Night offers the opportunity to discover research facilities that are usually not open to public (laboratories, research centres, museum collections, ...), use the most recent technologies and instruments with the guidance of scientists, participate in experiments, competitions and quizzes,  watch demonstrations and simulations, exchange ideas and party with the researchers. </span></span></span></h1>
                  <h1 class="text-rn"><span class="text-rn"><span class="text-rn"><span class="text-rn">One of the main messages of Researchers' Night is that researchers are &quot;ordinary people with an extraordinary job&quot;. Beyond their fascinating profession they are sportsmen, musicians, painters, singers, comedians, and they are ready to share their talent with the public.</span></span><br>
                  </span><br>
                  </h1>
                  <h1 class="text-rn"><span class="text-rn"><span class="text-rn"><strong>Is it of any interest to me?</strong></span></span><br>
                    <br>
                  <span class="text-rn"><span class="text-rn">The target audience of the event is the public at large, regardless of age and scientific background. It addresses all curious minds from enthusiasts to science-reluctant and offers a variety of fascinating activities for all.</span></span></h1>
                  <h1 class="text-rn"><span class="text-rn"><span class="text-rn">The mix of discovery and leisure activities (art, literature, music, gastronomy, sport) makes the success of the Researchers' Night, which offers an original alternative to more traditional Friday night activities. <br>
                  </span></span><br>

                  <h1 class="text-rn"><span class="text-rn"><span class="text-rn"><strong>Did I miss a Researchers' Night already?<br>
                   
                  </strong></span></span></h1>
                  <h1 class="text-rn"><span class="text-rn"><span class="text-rn"> The Researchers' Night was born in 2005 as part of   &quot;Researchers in Europe&quot; initiative, resulting form the Communication of the   European Commission to the Council and European Parliament &quot;Researchers in the   European Research Area: one profession, multiple careers&quot; (<a style="color:#fff" href="http://ec.europa.eu/research/fp6/mariecurie-actions/pdf/careercommunication_en.pdf" target="_blank">COM(2003)436</a>). &nbsp;</span></span></h1>
                  <h1 class="text-rn"><span class="text-rn"><span class="text-rn">The initiative implemented the Commission's   recommendation to &quot;launch a European Year of researchers to strengthen the   public recognition of careers in research &amp; development&quot;. It aimed at   enhancing public recognition of researchers, while stimulating more young people   to embark on scientific careers and contributing to the improvement of the   researchers' working environment.</span></span></h1>
                  <h1 class="text-rn"><span class="text-rn"><span class="text-rn">Since 2006, Researchers' Night exists as a self standing action under the <a style="color:#fff" href="http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/people/specific-actions_en.html" target="_blank">Marie Curie Actions</a> and has encountered an increasing success. Last year it was celebrated in more than 600 venues in 250 cities of 33 European countries. This year's total indicative budget for organising the night is &euro;4 million</span></span>.</h1>
                  <h1 class="text-rn"><span class="text-rn"><span class="text-rn">Take a look at the activities of previous editions.</span></span><br>

<h1 class="text-rn"><span class="text-rn"><span class="text-rn"><strong>I want to organise Researchers' Night</strong></span></span></h1>
                  <h1 class="text-rn"><span class="text-rn"><span class="text-rn">Researchers' Nights result from yearly calls for proposals. The proposals correspond to the list of activities detailed in the Work Programme. </span></span></h1>
<h1 class="text-rn"><span class="text-rn"><span class="text-rn">The 2012 call will be launched at the end of September. Take a look at the <a style="color:#fff"  href="http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/dc/index.cfm?fuseaction=UserSite.PeopleDetailsCallPage&call_id=375" target="_blank">2011 call</a>.</span></span></h1></td>
