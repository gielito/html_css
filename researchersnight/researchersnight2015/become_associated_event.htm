<p><strong>Associated events (from 2016 onwards):</strong>
<br><br>
This information concerns events that were not retained for funding after the call evaluation. The coordinators of these proposals will be contacted by letter by the Research Executive Agency (REA). This will state that requests from these consortia to associate their event with the NIGHT will automatically be approved by the REA. <br>
<br>

The country where the project is going to be undertaken, the title of the project, and its link to the website will be advertised on the European Researchers' Night (NIGHT) website in the events section. The project organisers will indicate clearly on the website of the project and in any promotional material (on-line and off-line) produced under the project that it is associated to the NIGHT event with the following wording:
<i>The (XXX) project is an associated event to the European Researchers' Night initiative of the European Union funded under the Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie actions. Call identifier: H2020-MSCA-NIGHT-XXX (title of the project and specific number of the call to be included).</i>
<br>
<br>

Please note that any project finally approved as an associated event would not imply that a future proposal submitted under an official call would be approved.
